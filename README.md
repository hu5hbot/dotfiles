These are my personal dotfiles I use across every device. Use
these files at your own risk, I do not maintain them or others.
I won't list off the packages needed either, so examine the code
yourself if you decide to rip the files directly. Most all of
what is found in this directory scales to the display of any
device as long as you change some variables.

-2024.12.11-
640x480 display update for micro-devices and laptops. The font
scales to any display to my knowledge if you're using the same
AUR ttf-sazanami as I am with bitmap fonts enabled. I have used
this setup on both a 640x480 display and a 1280x1024 display.
Use it at your own risk, I use StumpWM as a window manager.
