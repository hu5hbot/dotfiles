[Info]<br>
These are dotfiles I use across every device I can, use them at<br>
your own risk. There is no guarentee that these will work for  <br>
you, but they work on most every device I've ported them to.   <br>
I use StumpWM as my WM, this config assumes 640x480.           <br><br>

[Packages]<br>
- StumpWM       (Window manager)<br>
- XTerm         (Terminal emulator)<br>
- tamsyn-font (Global font)<br>
- hsetroot      (Background tiling)<br>
- ViM           (Editor)<br><br>

[Credits]<br>
Thank you to phundrak for the formatting of the StumpWM, I was<br>
struggling to get modules working originally but your code was<br>
very helpful, even if I don't agree with your methods.        <br><br>

Otherwise, these files are entirely mine, built up over the   <br>
time I spent using them. Very many sources, but it's mine now.<br><br>
