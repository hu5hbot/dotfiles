These are dotfiles I use across every device I can, use them at<br>
your own risk. There is no guarentee that these will work for  <br>
you, but they work on most every device I've ported them to.   <br>
Below are packages that are bare minimum to getting the files  <br>
to run happily. This accounts for all of them if you're porting<br>
them directly. If you're only using the WM file or the terminal<br>
resources, you can figure out what you need just by looking at <br>
the file itself. I use StumpWM as my window manager.           <br><br>

Thank you to phundrak for the formatting of the StumpWM, I was<br>
struggling to get modules working originally but your code was<br>
very helpful, even if I don't agree with your methods.        <br><br>

Otherwise, these files are entirely mine, built up over the   <br>
time I spent using them. Very many sources, but it's mine now.<br><br>
