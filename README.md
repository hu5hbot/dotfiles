These are my personal dotfiles I use across every device. Use
these files at your own risk, I do not maintain them or others.
I won't list off the packages needed either, so examine the code
yourself if you decide to rip the files directly. Most all of
what is found in this directory scales to the display of any
device as long as you change some variables.
